      <br />
      <br />
      <p><strong>Bio:</strong>
        I have always had a passion for health and fitness from a young age, however I grew up in the
        times of social media and influencers. As a young person, social media is where I receive all of
        my information. Everything I learnt about being healthy, training, and nutrition came from social
        media. Anybody with a social media account can post advice, so there's no surprise that I went
        down an unhealthy track at such a young age. I copied whatever these influencers ate, drank,
        and did. I’m sure you don't need to guess how that went for me. My self confidence, body
        image, and overall self belief was severely impacted by this. I felt like I wasn't good enough,
        simply because I didn't look like these influencers on instagram.
      </p>
      <p>
        I then decided to go and study,
        to educate myself on health and fitness. This led me on the path to create the XENA movement.
        I created this business as I believe girls need a positive influence, that can relate to them and
        their current lives. They need someone to tell them how to decipher from a positive influence,
        and a negative one. Someone to tell them that you don't need to look a certain way or fit into
        any sort of mould. Someone to tell them that who they are is exactly who they need to be.
      </p>

      <!-- I found my passion for fitness at a young age when I attended the gym with my dad,
        however as my passion grew I
        started to look upon social media influencers to find my education.
        My passion grew into an unhealthy obsession as I copied these influencer's workout for workout, meal for meal. I
        had nowhere to turn, to find proper training and nutrition advice, and soon my mindset began to weaken.
        I felt less of myself because I didn't look like these girls. I then decided to go and study, to educate myself
        on health and fitness. This has lead me on the path to creating XENA. I've created this business as it is what I
        wished I had when I was in School.
      </p>
      <p>The ages between 13-18 are fundamental in creating the habits and lifestyle that these girls will carry on for
        a lifetime. This is why it is vital to have a space that is relatable as well as reliable in guiding these
        girls along the right path.
        Not only this but the proven benefits of exercise on mental health are immense. By creating good habits early,
        having a space to exercise and learn about proper nutrition as well as ways to maintain our proper mental
        health, we are giving these girls the best chance at a happy and fulfilling life.

                <p>"Where do I begin Sophie hasn’t just changed my life physically but she has changed it mentally as
                  well.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Before I started training with Sophie I didn’t do one bit of exercise I would go on the occasional
                  coastal walk but that that was to a minimal now I train 4 times a week and 2 of them with her and I
                  BLOODY LOVE IT. I drive 45 minutes in the morning just to have a training session with her and it is
                  well worth it
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Sophie has way more faith in me that I do myself. Every week I say no I can’t do that much weight on a
                  deadlift or no I can’t plank for that long but she pushes me and here I am today hitting my PBs
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  The love she gives me is ridiculous I may not be feeling it one day and she will continue to push me
                  to the point she knows I can go to
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  I always used to think I have to be skinny or I have to be like that girl in the Instagram post with
                  the big bum and flats stomach and small thighs but I don’t I need to love myself for who I am and make
                  sure I am happy within and that was training with Sophie allows me to do
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  I may not be the fittest girl or hottest girl but according to Sophie I am the best and I will forever
                  be thankful for her for allowing me to feel mentally and physically happy about the girl I am today."
